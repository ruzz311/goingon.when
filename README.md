goingon.when (an extension on goingon.at)
==========

Going on when is an extension from a hack-a-thon (hack the midwest).  The original app geo-locates users and shows what's going on around you via social networks and google places.  This fork will add geo-fences to allow push updates and custom notifications when inside those bounderies
